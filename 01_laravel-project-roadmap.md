# Laravel Project Roadmap

Basically, I divided this project work into three major parts. The first part is to write the generators we already have. The second part is to develop a profile page where the user will see all their information and can download documents. Lastly, we have to develop an admin dashboard for maintaining and monitoring the application. We have 3 months or 12 weeks to complete this. Here is the roadmap we will follow to develop the project. I will use this roadmap to create tasks in Asana and will update you every week with a Loom video about the project's progress. Also, join the meeting on Tuesday.

## 1st Week -> Planning and Brainstorming

-   I and the new developer brainstormed about the project and planned what we were going to do.
-   I will design the system's database and its relationships.
-   We will discuss the technologies we’ll use and why.
-   We will prepare the project with all the necessary tooling, like formatter, linter, and initial dependencies.
-   I will set up application monitoring tools like Laravel Pulse.
-   We will use the Laravel Breeze starter kit for authentication. However, I will modify the code to fit our project.
-   Later, we will redesign the login, register, password reset, and verification pages using Jesan's custom designs.
-   Other initial setup tasks.

## 2nd to 5th Weeks -> Building Generators

-   I will convert all the generators from WordPress to Laravel, including writing proper migrations, factories, and seeders.
-   I will rewrite the checkout system and integrate it with the generators.
-   I will build a better coupon system for discounts.
-   We will convert templates to the Twig template engine, and mPDF to Blade and Browsershot for PDF generation.
-   I will convert the templates' CSS from inline to TailwindCSS for better design.
-   Jesan will provide improved designs for the generator’s step-by-step process.
-   I will build a more efficient PDF and ZIP downloading system, where documents are generated on the fly and cached files are regularly cleaned up.
-   Other potential tasks that may come up.

## 6th & 7th Weeks -> Building Profile

-   We will work on the customer’s profile section.
-   Jesan will provide a good design for the profile page with all necessary details.
-   Users will be able to download their PDFs and ZIPs and update their information.
-   We will redesign the login, register, password reset, and verification pages using Jesan's custom designs.
-   Other potential tasks that may come up.

## 8th to 11th Weeks -> Building Admin Dashboard

-   We will build a dashboard for monitoring the application, including users, paystubs, documents, etc.
-   We will manage coupons.
-   We will add a real sales metrics section where you can view the application's actual sales.
-   Other tasks that may arise.
-   Building the dashboard is a hard task, but we aim to create a valuable tool for business growth.

## 12th Week -> Bug Fixes and Deployment

-   This week, we will deploy the application using Laravel Forge.
-   We will fix bugs and perform final revisions.

As the project progresses, additional tasks will emerge. In every phase, we will review the work with you to ensure collaboration.
